Clean up the functions  (i.e. make them neat !!!)

(maybe limit the player to 10 guesses)
After an entered guess if there is no winner show the past guesses
have a function to show the score
use packages
use FX

// Globals
const int ESC = 27;		
int number; 		//Random Number that the computer generated !!
int n[4];			// The 4 random numbers !!!!
int guess[4];		// the 4 numbers that you guessed !!!
int MyGuess;		// the entered player's guess !!!
const int ROWS = 4;
int RIGHT = 0;		// number of correct postions
int WRONG = 0;		// number of incorrect positions

// prototypes for your functions !!!!
		 void error();// if you mess up
		 void play();// generate a random number
		 void player_guess();// enter a guess and call function winner

MasterMind needs

Consider making a limit on the number of guess's a user can have before being shut out.
If one player quits, it should not disable the other persons turns but allow them to finish.





For creating a secondary window window to capture user information

Source code for creating a secondary window with initModality...however, modality can not 
be changed / reestablished after setting to visible...so this will cause error the way 
MasterMind is using it.


newStage.initModality(Modality.APPLICATION_MODAL);	//to set this window as the top priority


public void ButtonClicked(ActionEvent e)
 {
     if (e.getSource()==btnscene1)
         newStage.showAndWait();
     else
         newStage.close();
 }



this is for the popup window.
